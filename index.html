    </h1>

    <p class="paragraph-P8">
      The Permissive Copyleft License (PCL) is a libre open-source license
      specifically crafted for both software source code and its corresponding
      binaries. Unlike licenses that strictly adhere to either purely permissive
      or rigidly copyleft principles, the PCL is designed as a long-term,
      balanced solution. It addresses the inherent challenges and potential
      drawbacks of both extremes: mitigating the risk of pure permissive
      licenses allowing unchecked proprietary forks that don't contribute back
      to the community, while avoiding the complexities and potential friction
      points sometimes associated with overtly strict copyleft licenses. The PCL
      aims to foster broad adoption and collaborative development by providing a
      framework that encourages contribution and sharing while remaining highly
      accessible for diverse use cases.
    </p>
    <h2 class="paragraph-P2">
      <a id="a__The_Philosophy_of_PCL"><span /></a
      ><span class="text-T2">The Philosophy of PCL</span>
    </h2>

    <p class="paragraph-P9">
      The Permissive Copyleft License (PCL) draws significant inspiration from
      the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International license, a
      well-established and widely understood license primarily used for
      non-software works. The core principles of CC BY-SA 4.0 have been
      carefully reinterpreted and reworded within the PCL to specifically
      address the unique characteristics and requirements of software
      development and distribution. This adaptation ensures that the fundamental
      spirit of "attribution and share-alike" is translated effectively into the
      context of source code and binaries, providing a familiar yet tailored
      framework for software creators and users.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph-P9">
      At the heart of the PCL's philosophy is the belief that the works created
      by software developers and contributors should be freely accessible and
      usable by anyone. This commitment to "libre" open source ensures that
      individuals, smaller organizations, and independent developers can readily
      benefit from and build upon PCL-licensed software. We envision a vibrant
      ecosystem where innovation is fostered through open access and
      collaboration, allowing the best ideas to flourish and propagate
      throughout the community.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph-P9">
      However, while promoting broad accessibility, the PCL also includes
      carefully considered provisions designed to prevent exploitation,
      particularly by major corporations who might otherwise leverage freely
      available code without contributing back or sharing their modifications.
      The copyleft aspect, inspired by the "ShareAlike" principle of CC BY-SA,
      requires that derivative works are also licensed under terms compatible
      with the PCL. This mechanism helps to ensure a more equitable exchange,
      encouraging reciprocal contributions and preventing a scenario where a few
      entities profit immensely without feeding back into the open-source
      community that made their success possible.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph-P9">
      The Permissive Copyleft License (PCL) has been meticulously crafted with a
      dual purpose: to actively encourage and facilitate robust open-source
      collaboration while simultaneously providing flexibility for companies and
      individuals who develop proprietary software. Recognizing that a healthy
      software ecosystem includes both open and closed source components, the
      PCL is designed to be a bridge between these worlds. Its structure
      encourages contributions back to the PCL-licensed project for
      modifications to the core code, fostering a strong collaborative
      environment for the benefit of the entire community.
    </p>
    <h2 class="paragraph-P3">
      <a id="a__Permissions_Granted_by_the_PCL"><span /></a>Permissions Granted
      by the PCL
    </h2>

    <p class="paragraph-P10">
      The PCL explicitly grants, without any fee or charge, the right to any
      person or organization who obtains the software licensed under its terms
      to utilize that software for commercial purposes. This means that
      individuals, startups, small businesses, and even large corporations are
      free to incorporate, run, and use the software as part of their
      revenue-generating activities, whether it's for internal operations,
      providing services, or building products that are sold for profit. There
      are no limitations or restrictions imposed by the license based on the
      user's intent to make money from the software's use.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph-P10">
      Furthermore, the PCL grants the right to distribute original and modified
      copies of the software. This is a cornerstone of open-source freedom,
      allowing users to share the software with others in its original form or
      after they have made changes or improvements. This permission facilitates
      the spread of the software, supports community involvement through sharing
      of modifications, and enables developers to build upon and enhance the
      original work. The ability to distribute modified versions is fundamental
      to collaborative development and the evolution of open-source projects.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph-P10">
      Finally, the PCL explicitly permits the private use of the software
      licensed under its terms. This guarantees that individuals and
      organizations can download, install, and run the software for their own
      internal use, whether for personal projects, within a company's
      infrastructure, or for any purpose that does not involve public
      distribution or direct commercial offering of the software itself. This
      ensures that the software is freely available for private exploration,
      experimentation, and application without the need for external interaction
      or public sharing.
    </p>
    <h2 class="paragraph-P4">
      <a id="a__Conditions_Using_PCL"><span /></a>Conditions Using PCL
    </h2>

    <p class="paragraph-P11">
      The broad permissions granted by the PCL, including commercial use,
      distribution, and private use, are subject to specific conditions that
      ensure the principles of attribution and share-alike are maintained. A
      primary condition is that any modifications made to the PCL-licensed
      software must be clearly documented and subsequently licensed under the
      same version of the PCL or a later version. This ensures that
      improvements, bug fixes, and new features developed on top of the original
      software are contributed back to the community under terms that are
      compatible with the original license, fostering a continuous cycle of
      development and sharing. It promotes transparency regarding changes and
      ensures that the derivative work remains under the PCL's protective
      framework.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph-P11">
      Furthermore, the PCL allows for the use of PCL-licensed software within
      larger software solutions that may be licensed under a different license,
      whether it be another open-source license or a proprietary (closed-source)
      license. This flexibility is a key aspect of the PCL's design, enabling
      its integration into a wide range of projects. However, this permission is
      contingent upon two important requirements: the developers of the larger
      software solution must clearly state their usage of the PCL-licensed
      software and must distribute any modified versions of the PCL-licensed
      software itself under the terms of the PCL. This ensures proper
      attribution to the original PCL project and guarantees that any
      enhancements made to the core PCL components are made available back to
      the community, even when used in a proprietary context.
    </p>
    <h2 class="paragraph-P5">
      <a id="a__Disclaimers"><span /></a>Disclaimers
    </h2>

    <p class="paragraph-Text_20_body">
      The Permissive Copyleft License (PCL), like most open-source licenses,
      includes a significant clause regarding the limitation of liability. This
      provision is crucial for protecting the original authors and contributors
      of the software. It typically states that the licensors (the creators and
      contributors of the software) shall not be held liable for any direct,
      indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages arising
      from the use or inability to use the software. This includes, but is not
      limited to, procurement of substitute goods or services, loss of use,
      data, or profits, or business interruption, regardless of how caused and
      on any theory of liability, whether in contract, strict liability, or tort
      (including negligence or otherwise), even if advised of the possibility of
      such damage. This limitation is essential for encouraging contributions to
      open-source projects, as developers are providing their work freely and
      cannot assume the burden of potential legal and financial risks associated
      with its diverse applications.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph-P12">
      In tandem with the limitation of liability, the PCL also incorporates a
      strong disclaimer of warranty. This clause clearly states that the
      software is provided "as is," without any warranty of any kind, either
      express or implied. This includes, but is not limited to, warranties of
      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
      The authors and contributors make no guarantees about the software's
      performance, reliability, accuracy, or suitability for any specific use
      case. Users bear the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the
      software and assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or
      correction. This disclaimer is a standard practice in open-source
      licensing, reflecting the nature of freely provided software that has not
      undergone rigorous commercial testing or quality assurance processes
      typically associated with proprietary products.
